## Project commands

Once your environment is configured you need to further prepare the project's tooling and dependencies.
In the project folder:

1. `yarn install` to download the packages specified in your project's *package.json* to the *node_modules* directory.

1. `yarn build` to compile your project. You must run this command after making changes to your TypeScript files. If it does not build locally, AutoTest will not be able to build it.
